		title: 'Infinite Banking & Debt Free Planning',
		text: 'Infinite banking refers to a process by which an individual becomes his or her own banker. The infinite banking concept was created by Nelson Nash. In his book, “Becoming Your Own Banker,” Nash talks about the use of whole life insurance policies that distribute dividends and how owning such policies allows individuals to dictate the cash flow in their lives by borrowing against/from themselves instead of depending on banks or lenders for loans.The amount you need to start infinite banking will depend on your life insurance policy provider. Age may affect the cost of monthly premiums, so it’s often best to start as early as possible. Since you can only borrow against the cash value savings portion, a large amount of money has to be contributed to the insurance policy over time before borrowing against it makes sense. Because of this, infinite banking may not always be a good solution for the average American.',
